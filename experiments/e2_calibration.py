"""E2: violation-injection calibration (headline experiment, milestone E2).

Inject one data-adequacy violation at a time, sweep severity, and test whether the
GATE verdict tracks where the naive (ungated) backbone fails. For each (arm, severity,
seed) we run the gate (precision readout -> n_recoverable -> verdict) and the naive
backbone (recover on every supplied environment, no gate) and compare.

Central claim: the gate abstains/caps where naive recovery degrades, so it PREDICTS
failure instead of the method failing silently. Kill criterion (design doc): if the
gate verdict does not track naive failure (calibration flat), the claim is false.

PRE-REGISTERED EXPECTATIONS (written before running; a contradiction is reported as a
finding, not tuned away):
  A ENVIRONMENT STARVATION (drop interventional environments m from 5 to 1; gate P1
    caps n_max_env = m). EXPECT tight tracking: gate n_recoverable = m equals the
    number of directions naive recovers; naive MCC over all 5 latents falls as m
    falls; the gate flips PROCEED -> PROCEED_CAPPED exactly when a direction is lost
    (m < 5). Direction: gate tracks, YES.
  B POWER STARVATION (shrink per-environment n_e; gate P2, realized via precision
    detectability at low n). EXPECT the gate to grow CONSERVATIVE as n_e falls
    (precision count drops / abstains) while the linear backbone stays sample-robust,
    so the gate abstains before naive actually fails. Direction: gate degrades in the
    safe direction (never PROCEED while naive collapses), YES, with over-conservatism
    noted.
  C MEASUREMENT CONTAMINATION (replace c of 5 environments with a measurement gain
    shift on the mixing, no latent intervention). Per decision R1 the mechanism-vs-
    measurement gate P3 is temporal-only and this simulator is not temporal, so this
    arm is DETECTABILITY-BASED, not P3-based. EXPECT the covariance/precision gate
    CANNOT distinguish a measurement change from a mechanism change and is partially
    FOOLED (certifies contaminated directions) while naive degrades. Direction: gate
    does NOT reliably track here, a documented limitation needing P3.
  D RANK / WEAK-SIGNAL STARVATION. In this atomic construction reducing the number of
    intervened nodes is the SAME manipulation as arm A, so D is realized as
    intervention-strength weakening (iv_scale 0.1 -> 1.0), a distinct signal axis.
    EXPECT the gate to grow conservative (count drops / abstains) as the intervention
    weakens while the backbone stays signal-robust. Direction: gate degrades in the
    safe direction, YES, with over-conservatism noted; node-count starvation is
    covered by arm A.

Read-only in spirit: imports the simulator, precision gate readout, backbone
(including its _unmixing_row building block, composed here for the partial/naive
recovery because backbone.recover requires full target coverage), discover, and the
E0 mcc; modifies none of them.

Writes results/e2/e2_calibration_report.json (tracked); prints a per-arm severity
table; exits non-zero only if the central claim is KILLED (no arm shows tracking).
