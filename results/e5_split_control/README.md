# E5: split-control gate (Tier 2, Experiment B)

For each dataset and gate seed the control cells are split once, 50/50 at random
(`SeedSequence([5050, seed])`): Half A builds every environment's null, with the
unchanged size matching, and Half B is the fixed reference, never resampled, so the
observed statistic is `T_e = lambda_max(Omega_e - Omega_B)`. Everything else is
unchanged (precision readout, disjoint split inside Half A when `n_e <= n_A/2`, BH
within family at q=0.05, control-fit projection on all control cells), and no
recovery is run. Every family is screened under both the shared-reference design
(`corrected_disjoint`, which reproduces E3) and the split design (`split_control`)
on identical inputs and per-environment null streams.

Produced by `experiments/e5_split_control.py` (launcher:
`experiments/run_tier2_a100.sh`); the gate switch is `Y_null` in
`precision_readout.detect_with_pvalues`, and `experiments/tier2_screen.py
--split-control` screens one dataset and seed.

## JSON keys

`e5_real_panel.json` (layout of `results/e3_stability/<name>.json`, five seeds)
- `datasets.<name>.shared_vs_split.per_seed[]`: `shared` and `split` raw_count and bh_count,
  `jaccard_bh` (None when both BH sets are empty), plus the same for `negative_controls`.
- `datasets.<name>.shared_vs_split.summary`: seed means.
- `datasets.<name>.perturbation_stability`, `negative_control_stability`: per-design fraction
  mean, SD and per-seed values.
- `datasets.<name>.per_seed[].split`: half sizes and a SHA-256 of the Half A indices.
- `datasets.<name>.per_seed[].shared_reproduces_e3_stability`: whether the shared design
  reproduced the committed E3 raw and BH sets exactly.

`e5_rpe1_confound.json` (layout of `results/e3/e3_rpe1_confound_check.json`, seed 0)
- `perturbation_screen`, `random_control_screen`, `structured_control_screen`: both designs.
- `shared_vs_split.<perturbations|random_controls|structured_controls>`.
- `shared_reproduces_e3.checks`: reproduction of the committed E3 decisions per family.

`e5_poscontrol.json` (layout of `results/e3_poscontrol/poscontrol_final.json`)
- `smoke_snr8`, `dose_response[]`: planted and null-draw screens under both designs.
- `shared_vs_split.<ratio>`: planted and null-draw counts under both designs.
- `split_geometry_note`: read this before interpreting the split arm (below).

## Caveat for the positive control

The observational draw there has 200 cells, so each half has 100 and every 200-cell
environment is larger than Half A. The split null then falls back to 200 draws with
replacement from 100 rows while the observed statistic compares 200 cells with a
100-cell reference. It is run as specified, but it is not a like-for-like null for
that construction.
